# I have a question
#### How to use?
- Download EFI folder, get [GenSMBIOS](https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS) and generate your own serial number. [Guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/config-laptop.plist/skylake.html#platforminfo).
- Then put inside your EFI folder
#### Where your SD Card reader?
- It's broken before.
#### Will you update kexts, OC,etc?
- Yes I will but occasionally because I think new version are not necessary so just stay in current version.
#### I have a problem/error/stuck
- [Google it](https://www.google.com).

- [Make your own EFI](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/prerequisites.html)
- I'm not a hackintosh expert, some problem I can help you but not all.
#### Can you make X to work?
- If I find out a way to make it works, I will update on Github.
